In Marsiling Secondary School, we believe that being different does not mean less. Every student is given an equal opportunity to learn and participate in activities. We practice inclusive classroom strategies to support the needs of our students with Special Educational Needs (SEN). Our SEN students are monitored and classified into 3 different tiers of support based on their level of needs. Interventions in the form of In-Class support and withdrawal sessions are conducted by the Special Educational Needs Officer (SENO) for students who require additional support. Withdrawal sessions conducted by SENO are focused on providing skills and strategies in 3 areas of needs as follows: –

Area of Need 1: Literacy Skills

Area of Need 2: Behavioural Management

Area of Need 3: Social Skills

The support encompasses needs-based interventions and participation of stakeholders involving parents, school personnel and external agencies.
