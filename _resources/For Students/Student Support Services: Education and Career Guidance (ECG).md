**Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Counsellor**

The ECG Counsellor works closely with Marsiling Secondary School to support and cater to the needs of this school student’s profiles. All graduating classes are to attend a mandatory scheduled ECG group counselling session with him prior to self booking or referral ECG appointments and Parents are welcome to book an ECG appointment with the ECG Counsellor together with students as well.

During the group ECG session, ECG tools and various online resources will be shared with the students. With the guidance of an ECG Counsellor, the ECG counsellor and student shall explore together the student’s education pathway/s and career interest/s based on the following 3 ECG questions: 

*   Who Am I? (Discovering Purpose)
*   Where Do I Want To Go? (Exploring Opportunities)
*   How Do I Get There? (Staying Relevant)

The ECG Counsellor will also provide guidance to support students on their EAE write-ups, portfolios and interviews. These are the two most popular education pathways apart from DSA/PFP/DPP/JIE/JAE/ETC. Nearer the EAE timeline, the School and ECG Counsellor will conduct talks and workshops and share more on EAE in a timely manner (students will be reminded to book an ECG appointment if they need personal tips or additional support by then). 

Popular pathway #1: Poly EAE: [https://eae.polytechnic.edu.sg/eaeStudIns/menu.jsp](https://eae.polytechnic.edu.sg/eaeStudIns/menu.jsp)

Extracted from source: “The Polytechnic Early Admissions Exercise (Poly EAE) is an aptitude-based admissions exercise that allows students to apply for and receive conditional offers for admission to polytechnics prior to receiving their final grades. It allows the polytechnics greater flexibility to select and admit students based on their aptitudes and interests, apart from academic grades, thus allowing a wider range of talents to be recognised.

Poly EAE is open to graduating O-Level students, final-year _Nitec_ and _Higher Nitec_ students from the Institute of Technical Education and Adults (Singapore Citizen or Permanent Residents only) who have two or more years of relevant work experience.”

Popular pathway #2: ITE EAE: [https://www.ite.edu.sg/admissions/full-time-courses/early-admissions-exercise](https://www.ite.edu.sg/admissions/full-time-courses/early-admissions-exercise)

Extracted from source: “The ITE Early Admissions Exercise (ITE EAE) is an aptitude-based admissions exercise. If you have strong aptitude and passion in a field related to a _Nitec_ or _Higher Nitec_ course, the ITE EAE is for you. We will also consider your relevant work experience and your achievements in sports, arts, leadership, entrepreneurship and community service.

The application process involves an interview for each of your course choices (if shortlisted).

If your application is successful, you will receive a conditional offer for admission to one of your course choices.

Your place in the course will be confirmed if you accept the conditional offer and your GCE N/O-Level or final _Nitec_ examination results meet the Minimum Entry Requirements of the course.”
