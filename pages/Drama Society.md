**Background**

Drama is a dynamic performing arts CCA which requires passion, stamina, teamwork and commitment. Marsiling Drama Society was formed since the school started and has competed in drama competitions and represented the school in the Singapore Youth festivals. The drama group focusses on both stage performance and online performance.

We have achieved the certificate of accomplishment since 2019 and aims to maintain a high quality and standard of our drama members and drama program. Our CCA welcomes interested students from all races and gender. To date we have about 30 drama members and two experience drama instructors who have 10 years of experience and an excellent team of teachers to bring out the best in the drama members. The Drama programme has proven to be an effective way to help our students develop personal qualities such as teamwork, self-discipline and leadership skills.

**Training Programme**

This programme ensures that all drama members are competent with basic and advance drama skills (movement, voice, improvisation, stage business, characterisation, acting techniques) and building up self-discipline and confidence while fostering team building.

During periods of competition, there will be additional training sessions to sufficiently prepare the drama members.

Training Frequency:&nbsp;2 sessions (2.5 hours each) per week
