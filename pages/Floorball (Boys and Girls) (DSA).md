**Background**

Floorball is a fast-paced indoor sport that requires quickness of mind, tenacity, speed, agility, fitness and teamwork. It is an exciting team sport that appeals to many. Marsiling’s Floorball was formed in 2020 to cater to students’ interest. We aim to create a dynamic environment for the young ladies where they can excel. Trainings are of high intensity and yet fun. We hope to have more young ladies come forward to train with us and make their mark during their stay with us and beyond.

To date the school has some 50 students training in the sport. We have state of the art Floorball equipment housed within a new Indoor Sports Hall and a very strong environment to nurture the players; even if they have little or no background in the sport. The girls are well equipped with their own floorball sticks, shoes, jerseys and an excellent team of teachers and coaches to bring out the best in the girls. The Floorball programme has proven to be an effective way to help our students develop personal qualities such as teamwork, self-discipline and leadership skills.

**Training Programme**

This programme ensures that all players are competent with Floorball skills and play (skills to&nbsp;dribble, pass, shoot and defend, as well as fitness training to improve endurance and footwork).

During periods of competition, there will be additional training sessions to sufficiently prepare the girls for the tournament. Friendly matches will also be arranged to help the players gain more game experience.

Training Frequency: 2 sessions (3 hours each) per week
