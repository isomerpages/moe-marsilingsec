**Background**

International Dance is a dynamic performing arts CCA which requires passion, stamina, teamwork and commitment. Marsiling International dance, Hypesters, was formed when the Marsiling Secondary School merged with Si Ling Secondary School in 2017. Hypesters has competed in dance competitions, performed at community events and represented the school in the Singapore Youth festivals. The dance group focuses on Hip Hop and Street Jazz.

We have achieved the certificate of achievement since 2017 and aim to maintain the quality and standard of our dancers and dance program. Our CCA welcomes interested students from all races and gender. To date we have about 40 dancers and an experienced dance instructor to bring out the best in the dancers. The International Dance programme has proven to be an effective way to help our students develop personal qualities such as teamwork, self-discipline and leadership skills.

**Training Programme**

This programme ensures that all dancers are competent from the warm-ups, to the techniques, and eventually choreographies. Stamina building and strength training are  core components built through various exercises.

During periods of competitions and performances, there will be additional training sessions to sufficiently prepare the dancers.

Training Frequency: 2 sessions (2.5 hours each) per week
