Marsiling Secondary School’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) - Eco-sustainability through Inquiry-Based Learning – is in the area of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). &nbsp;All students participate in a three-year environment education programme which offers modules focused on science and technology for lower secondary students, and projects and advanced elective modules jointly developed with the polytechnics for the upper secondary levels. The programme augments the school’s effort to inculcate the values of responsibility, resilience and respect by exposing our students to environment-related activities.&nbsp;Through our caring teachers we nurture our students to help trail-blaze the school’s environment education efforts to the community and beyond.

The school was a recipient of the 2012 President’s Award for the Environment. As the recipient of the BCA Green Mark Platinum award in late 2018, the school also promotes sustainability in the built environment. In 2019, Marsiling Secondary School was awarded Top Vanda Miss Joaquim in the SEC-StarHub School Green Awards (SGA) for our efforts in raising environmental awareness among students and the community.

As a school offering a distinctive programme on Environmental Science and Sustainable Living, we have vacancies for up to 20% of our 2023 Secondary 1 cohort and we welcome interested students to apply to join the school through the Direct School Admission (DSA) process.
