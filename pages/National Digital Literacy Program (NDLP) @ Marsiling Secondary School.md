### National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)

At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021. This page provides important information about the PDLP and how you can purchase the PLD for your child/ward as well as about the accompanying applications that the school may be rolling out as part of the NDLP.

### Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) @ Marsiling Secondary School

In the 21st century, Computing Devices and Internet Connection plays a huge role in all facets of life. The use of ICT in education adds value to teaching and learning, by enhancing the effectiveness of learning. It added a dimension to learning that was not previously available.

Marsiling Secondary School (MSS) is committed to nurture a community of Dynamic, Confident and Caring Digital Future-Ready Learners. With the availability of Personal Learning Devices (PLDs), students will be able to stay connected and access information easily, communicating and collaborating of ideas in school, enabling them to learn actively both within and outside of their classrooms.

For **NDLP@MSS**, we are kicking off the Personal Learning Device (PLD) ownerships **to all Secondary 1, 2, 3 and 4 students.**

The school have identified the PLD to be IPAD. It is important for all Sec 1, 2 3 and 4 students to have the same PLDs as to have a coherent teaching and learning ecosystem in the school.

**Personal Learning Device (PLD) for Secondary School Students**

**Overview.** The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) – as well as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning. This will also enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world.

**Purchase of PLD bundle.** The school has made arrangements for you to purchase the PLD from **AsiaPac Distribution Pte Ltd** for your child’s/ward’s use in school. The vendor has been identified based on the choice of device determined by the school from a panel of awarded suppliers established by MOE. The PLD bundle which includes warranty and insurance for purchase by your child/ward will be:

*   _Apple iPad 10.2“ (9th Gen, WIFI, 64GB)_
*   _A13 Bionic chip, 3GB RAM, 64GB Storage,_
*   _10.2” Screen Size_
*   _3-year insurance_
    *   _Covering 2 repairs or 1 replacement\* (Accidental Loss will not be replaced)._
*   Ruggedized Combo 3
    *   Shock-absorbent Rugged Folio case with integrated keyboard

### **Use of Edusave**

If your child/ward is a Singapore citizen, you can use your child’s/ward’s Edusave to pay partly or fully for the PLD. A Singapore citizen student can use up to the available Edusave balance in his/her Edusave account to pay for the PLD after setting aside provision for payment of 2nd tier miscellaneous fees. MOE has provided a one-off Edusave top-up of $200 in 2020, to all eligible Singaporean students in primary and secondary schools. This is on top of the annual Edusave contribution of $290 for secondary students and $230 for primary students. Parents/guardians can also choose to pay cash for the PLD. Please note that it is compulsory for all existing students on the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme to use their Edusave to pay for the PLD, after subsidies have been granted.

### **Financial Assistance**

Subsidies are available for students who require financial assistance to purchase a PLD. Please refer to the [parent briefing slides](/files/NDLP-Briefing-for-Parents-20-Jan-2021.pdf) for further details on funding support. Students under the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme for the year will automatically be subsidized for the PLD. Students who are currently not under the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme may approach the school’s General Office to apply for additional subsidy if their Gross Household Income (GHI) is $4,000 or less, or Per Capita Income (PCI) is $1,000 or less. “**PCI**” refers to the Gross Household Income divided by the total number of family members in the household.

### **Device Management Application**

Please note that when you purchase a PLD, **the PLD will be pre-installed with a Device Management Application (DMA)**. The DMA has a variety of functions that will support the use of the PLD in the classroom, as well as safeguard students’ cyber-wellness. The DMA has 3 main components:

*   **Classroom Management Service**. This enables teachers to actively monitor and control the student’s use of the PLD during lesson time to improve student management and deliver effective teaching.
*   **Mobile Device Management Service**. This facilitates the remote deployment of teaching and learning applications and comes with security patches. The school may also leverage on the Mobile Device Management Service to install teaching and learning resources.
*   **Usage Management Service**. This allows the school to address cyber wellness concerns, such as excessive and inappropriate use of the PLD and manage prolonged use of the PLD to reduce stress on the eyes.

**Cyber-wellness**. In rolling out the PLD, MOE is acutely aware of concerns regarding students’ cyber-wellness. The DMA allows the school to manage this, by

*   collecting data on usage by the student, such as the amount of time spent on each application,
*   monitoring, filtering and limiting the type of websites accessible to the student, and
*   placing restrictions on students’ screen time in order to prevent cyber addiction.

Please refer to our Frequently Asked Questions section (Below) for more information on the DMA as well as MOE’s collection of data.

### **Applications**

As part of the NDLP, schools will progressively roll out IT applications that will be vital to students’ learning experience and educational journey. In the following months, the school will roll out some or all of the following applications:

*   **Student iCON**: Every secondary school student will be given an email address. This is a service provided by Google as part of Google Suite.
*   **Microsoft Pro Plus**: Every secondary school student will be able to use Microsoft Office tools that include Word, PowerPoint and Excel.
*   **Zoom**: Every secondary school student will be given a Zoom free account with 40 mins time limit using the Student iCON for the students’ video conferencing needs.

Schools may also choose to roll out applications other than those listed above. The school will need to use your child’s/ward’s personal data such as his/her name and class to set up user accounts. Please refer to our Frequently Asked Questions section for more information on the collection of data via these applications.

### **Frequently Asked Questions**

**1\. How will my child’s/ward’s data be used in** **the PLD and IT Applications?**

**DMA.** The Device Management Application (DMA) which will be installed in your child’s/ward’s PLD collects data on usage by the student, such as the amount of time spent on each application. The DMA data will only be used for MOE’s cyber-wellness measures and technical troubleshooting. MOE will not disclose the data to any person otherwise than permitted under the law.

**IT Applications.** For the IT Applications (student iCON, Microsoft ProPlus and Zoom), the school will use your child’s/ward’s personal data such as his/her name, birth certificate number and class to set up user accounts. This data will also be used for the purposes of authenticating and verifying user identity, troubleshooting and facilitating system improvements. In addition, the commercial providers of these platforms (e.g. Google, Microsoft) will collect and deal with user data generated by your child’s/ward’s use of these applications. The collection use and disclosure of such data are governed by the commercial provider’s terms of use, which can be found here:

*   Student iCON: [https://workspace.google.com/terms/education\_terms\_japan.html](https://workspace.google.com/terms/education_terms_japan.html)

**2\. Where will the data collected by DMA and IT Applications for NDLP be stored?**

All user data which is collected by MOE will be stored in secure servers managed by the respective vendors of our systems. The Government has put in place strong personal data protection laws and policies to safeguard sensitive data collected by public agencies such as MOE. Please refer to this website for more information on these laws and policies: [https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/why-Smart-Nation/secure-smart-nation/personal-data-protection](https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/why-Smart-Nation/secure-smart-nation/personal-data-protection)

**3\. Where can I find the full terms of purchase of the PLD?**

Parents/guardians will be purchasing the PLD directly from the vendor, not MOE. This is pursuant to a bulk tender agreement between MOE and the vendor. The tender documents set out the full terms and conditions of such a purchase, and can be found at this website: [https://go.gov.sg/pldtermsandconditions](https://go.gov.sg/pldtermsandconditions)
