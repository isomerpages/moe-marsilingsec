**b. Selection (June 2023 – September 2023)**

Amid the recent increase in the number of local COVID-19 cases and to ensure the safety and well-being of our students and school personnel, DSA-Sec schools and Primary Schools will continue to use **e-modes for the selection process of all talent areas during this year’s DSA exercises (i.e. similar to last year’s DSA exercises)**.

**The school offers vacancies of up to 20% of the 2024 Secondary 1 cohort and we welcome interested students to apply to join the school through the Direct School Admission (DSA) process.**
