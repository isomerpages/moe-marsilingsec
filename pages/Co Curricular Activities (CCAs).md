Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) are an integral part of our students’ holistic education. Through CCA, students discover their interests and talents while developing values and competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world. CCA also promotes friendships among students from diverse backgrounds as they learn, play and grow together. Participation in CCA fosters social integration and deepens students’ sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility to school, community and nation.

Every secondary school student takes part in one CCA taken from the following options:

*   Clubs and Societies
*   Physical Sports
*   Uniformed Groups
*   Visual and Performing Arts Group

Students who are keen on an activity not offered in school may seek the school’s approval to start their own activities. This gives students the chance to pursue their specific interests or ideas, and expands the range of activities available in school.
