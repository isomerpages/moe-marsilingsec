The Direct School Admission (DSA) Exercise is an admission exercise to allow participating secondary schools to select some Primary 6 students for admission to Secondary One based on their achievements and talents before the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results are released. It seeks to promote holistic education and provide students with an opportunity to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents in seeking admission to a secondary school.

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.

Marsiling Secondary School’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Sports and Outdoor Education is also known as **_V_**_alues **A**nd **L**eadership Development Through **OU**tdoor Cu**R**riculum (**VALOUR).**_ It has become a distinctive programme in the school since its establishment in 2014. Outdoor Education provides rich learning experiences outside the classroom that can help our students develop holistically, building up their resilience, ruggedness and leadership attributes. Many of these experiences cannot be replicated in the classroom but are very important in helping our students develop 21st century competencies as well as competencies for sustainable, active and healthy living.

**_VALOUR_**  steers students to move out of their comfort zone to be engaged in activities and expeditions that create conditions for rich and positive experiences. Such experiences of success often lead to change that will impact them throughout their lives.

Through **_VALOUR_**, we nurture students to be independent, determined and in possession of the tenacity to persevere and achieve. Our flagship programmes equip them for lifelong learning. This development programme puts students from Secondary 1 to Secondary 5 through activities that nurture their leadership potential, impart life skills, school values and infuse socio-emotional competencies in them. Other qualities like teamwork and self-confidence are also inculcated through the programme.

**<u>Selection Criteria</u>**

*   **Attitude and Personality**: Students must have a keen interest in outdoor activities and are willing to take on physical and emotional challenges. Students must also have the desire to learn and be receptive to guidance and instruction.
*   **Academic**: Must be in Primary 6 at the point of application or equivalent.
*   **Physical**: Students must be reasonably fit as assessed through the NAPFA criteria and are able to participate in physical activities.

Marsiling Secondary School’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – Eco-sustainability through Inquiry-Based Learning – is in the area of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM).  All students participate in a three-year environment education programme which offers modules focused on science and technology for lower secondary students, and projects and advanced elective modules jointly developed with the polytechnics for the upper secondary levels.

The school was a recipient of the 2012 President’s Award for the Environment. As the recipient of the BCA Green Mark Platinum award in late 2018, the school also promotes sustainability in the built environment.

**Background**

Floorball is a fast-paced indoor sport that requires quickness of mind, tenacity, speed, agility, fitness and teamwork. It is an exciting team sport that appeals to many. Marsiling’s Floorball was formed in 2020 to cater to students’ interest. We aim to create a dynamic environment for the young ladies where they can excel. Trainings are of high intensity and yet fun. We hope to have more young ladies come forward to train with us and make their mark during their stay with us and beyond.

To date the school has some 50 students training in the sport. We have state of the art Floorball equipment housed within a new Indoor Sports Hall and a very strong environment to nurture the players; even if they have little or no background in the sport. The girls are well equipped with their own floorball sticks, shoes, jerseys and an excellent team of teachers and coaches to bring out the best in the girls. The Floorball programme has proven to be an effective way to help our students develop personal qualities such as teamwork, self-discipline and leadership skills.

**Training Programme**

This programme ensures that all players are competent with Floorball skills and play (skills to dribble, pass, shoot and defend, as well as fitness training to improve endurance and footwork).

During periods of competition, there will be additional training sessions to sufficiently prepare the girls for the tournament. Friendly matches will also be arranged to help the players gain more game experience.

Training Frequency: 2 sessions (3 hours each) per week
