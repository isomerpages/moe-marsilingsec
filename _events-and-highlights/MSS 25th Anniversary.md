<p><strong>Pledging a Gift to Marsiling Secondary School</strong>
</p>
<p>As we celebrate our schoolâ€™s 25th anniversary, we invite all members of
our school community to make this milestone even more meaningful by pledging
a special gift! But these are no ordinary giftsâ€”they represent aspirations
that can bring value to our school and its people. More than just words,
these pledges are commitments backed by action, coming together to create
a lasting impact.</p>
<p>Think of it as a promiseâ€”whether big or smallâ€”to contribute positively
to our school. It could be striving for academic excellence, showcasing
our schoolâ€™s talents in competitions, or simply spreading kindness and
positivity every day.</p>
<p>ðŸ’¡ <strong>What can we pledge?</strong>
