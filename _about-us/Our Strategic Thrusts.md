The Strategic Thrusts
---------------------

#### 1\. Effective Dynamic & Confident Learners through Mastery & Applied Learning

To provide quality learning experience to develop students into effective dynamic and confident learners  who display quality thinking dispositions

The school believes that all students can think and want to learn. The school aims to provide quality learning experiences, where the skills and disposition of self directed learning are seeded in students through their experiences in the total curriculum. These skills and disposition include questioning, reflecting, persevering and taking responsibilities for his/her own learning.

#### 2\. Strengthen Moral and Performance Character

To strengthen moral and performance character of students to develop them into responsible and concerned citizens who believe and contribute to bettering the lives of others in the community

The school believes that students can be nurtured in both minds and morals. For the progressive development of students’ character, the short term goal is to develop in them a sense of self awareness, self management  
and to instill values such as respect, responsibility and resilience. These are important to allow students to understand their own emotions, strengths, inclinations and weaknesses so that they can manage their emotions, exercise self discipline and display strong goal setting and organisation skills. These traits will allow them to be self directed learners who can relate positively to others. They will also have the fundamentals to become  
responsible and concerned citizens who can contribute to bettering the lives of others in the community  
which is the desired outcome embedded in the school’s VMV.

#### 3\. Nurture a Community of Dynamic & Caring Professionals

To build a community of staff who are respectful, responsible and resilient in striving for excellence in the holistic development of students

The school believes that all staff are valued and would want to contribute. The school will seek to “enable” (raise the competency level of professional learning), “empower” (provide opportunities for staff development to realise their potential) and “engage” (recognise staff for their contributions and enhance their wellbeing) each staff so that staff will provide quality learning experiences and strengthen students’ performance and moral character to achieve the school’s VMV.

#### 4\. Leverage Collaborative Partnerships for School Excellence

To build strategic partnerships that are impactful & mutually beneficial in expanding the school’s capacity to fulfill the school’s vision and mission

The school believes that mutually beneficial relationships that are based on trust, sharing of knowledge and integration of efforts would optimise the school’s resources in providing students with a holistic education that develops them into self directed and caring individuals.
