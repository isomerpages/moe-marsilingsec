At Marsiling Secondary, we pride ourselves on providing a holistic education that develop our students into respectful, responsible and resilient individuals. The school seeks to develop students who care for self and others, take ownership of their own growth and make full use of their talents, and persevere in the face of challenges.

We adopt a whole school approach towards student development with every educator, a character builder and a discipline teacher.

At the heart of our school mission is the Guiding Principle of  ‘GRIT’.  This broad philosophy encompasses our beliefs and values and guides us in our decision making in all circumstances, irrespective of changes in our goals, strategies or type of work.

Under the guiding hands of our teachers, we have gained sustained achievement in our academic and non-academic domains.
