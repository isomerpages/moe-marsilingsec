<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Respect:</u> </strong>To respect someone is to give due regard
to their feelings, wishes or rights. To demonstrate the value of respect,
we should also recognise that dignity and care should be accorded to every
individual. We respect self, others, environment as well as properties.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Responsibility:</u> </strong><em>To be responsible is to be accountable for our own behaviours and actions. We encourage all students to take personal responsibility over their learning, wellbeing and safety. We also encourage students to practise leadership where they extend their responsibility to account for the learning, wellbeing and safety of the team members they are leading.</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Resilience:</u> </strong><em>To demonstrate resilience is to adopt a growth mindset, to bounce back from setbacks, and to continue to learn and try again until we succeed. There is no failure in life, only lessons to be learnt. True failure only happens when we quit.</em>
