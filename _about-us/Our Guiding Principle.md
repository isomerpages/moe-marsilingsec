**G.R.I.T (Growth, Resourcefulness, Innovation & Tenacity)**

At the heart of our school mission is the Guiding Principle of  ‘GRIT’.  This broad philosophy encompasses our beliefs and values and guides us in our decision making in all circumstances, irrespective of changes in our goals, strategies or type of work.

Dr Angela Lee, an expert in this area, defines “GRIT” as “passion and perseverance for very long term goals. It is about having stamina and sticking with your future, day in, day out. Not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality. It is living life like a marathon, not a sprint”.

She also shares a simple formula for achievement.

“Without effort, your talent is nothing more than your unmet potential. Without effort, your skill is nothing more than what you could have done but didn’t. With effort, talent becomes skill, and the very same time, effort makes skill productive”? Angela Duckworth, [Grit](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/45670634): The Power of Passion and Perseverance

In MSS, we have further distilled “G.R.I.T” to mean Growth, Resourcefulness, Innovation and Tenacity to serve as guide for our actions. We believe that with this mindset and guiding principle, we can overcome all challenges and achieve our School Vision of a Dynamic, Confident and Caring Learner.
