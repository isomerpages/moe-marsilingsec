**School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos**  
Marsiling Secondary School is implementing Full Subject-Based Banding from 2022. We aim to seed the skills and dispositions of confident learners and develop caring individuals with a heart for the society. We pride ourselves on providing a holistic education that develops our students into respectful, responsible and resilient individuals. MSS adopts a whole-school positive discipline approach towards developing all Marsilians. “G.R.I.T” meaning Growth, Resourcefulness, Innovation and Tenacity, serves as a guide to shape our school culture. Our literacy and numeracy programmes strengthen the foundations of our weaker students and stretch the more able ones. We are also committed to staff professional development to ensure that our staff members are competent in helping students experience success in both the academic and non-academic domains. There is a strong and pervasive ethos of care and our students feel that the school is a safe environment for learning and growth.

Remarks:

1) Meeting the indicative cut-off point (COP) does not guarantee admission to the school. The current year’s PSLE Score ranges may vary, depending on the demand pattern and cohort size.

2) The last posted student had a PSLE Score better than 30. However, as the school still had N(T) vacancies after S1 Posting, its COP is reflected as 30 as it could have admitted a S1-eligible student with PSLE Score of 30.
