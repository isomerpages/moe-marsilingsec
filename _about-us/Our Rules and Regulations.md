#### Discipline and conduct

Students’ discipline is paramount in creating a safe and conducive environment for effective teaching and learning to take place. Students’ positive conduct is developed through an educative process that focuses on self-ownership and taking responsibility of their own actions. Therefore, the school rules and regulations are put in place so as to achieve this purpose. Through positive discipline, students’ character will be developed by adhering to the rules and regulations.
