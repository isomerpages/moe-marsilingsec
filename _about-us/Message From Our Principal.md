**Principal’s Message 2022**

**Progressing with Values and Knowledge**

Marsiling Secondary School ![](/images/MSS_chinese-6.jpeg) is making steady progress with _values and knowledge_! We are honoured to be given the approval and had successfully implemented Full Subject Based Banding (**FSBB**) for the Secondary One cohort this year, two years ahead of the deadline sets for all secondary schools in Singapore.

Another key event for the school this year was the official opening of the **Indoor Sports Hall** by Mr. Zaqy Mohamad, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Defence and Manpower and Adviser to Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC GROs on 25th March. Our Uniformed Groups Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) members had the opportunity to put on their smart number one uniforms and our performing arts CCAs members were also extremely elated to be able to showcase their talents during the event. I am confident that such an impressive addition to our up-to-date facilities will benefit both the students and the Woodlands community as a dual-use scheme facility in the estate.

Despite the pandemic, the school continued to achieve outstanding **academic results** in 2021. New records were set for the Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of Education (GCE) Examinations, all indicators tracked by Ministry of Education (PRISM) either **met or above expectation**. More importantly, 76 students from the Normal (Academic) course who sat for the Ordinary-Level subjects did exceptionally well with 45 of them scoring B4 or better. In fact, 51% of the entire Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) streams of the school were given the opportunity to take up at least one **above stream subject**, an initiative in giving our students an added advantage in progression to the next stage of education.

Despite the initial uncertainty, our sports CCAs prepared well for the National School Games (NSG) and our young Sepak Takraw team (2nd year in formation) emerged as the **National Champion** for the ‘B’ Division, a spectacular performance that surprised many. It was truly an exhibition of the school’s guiding principles: **G.R.I.T (Courage and Resolve).**

With outstanding **Singapore Youth Festival** performances in 2021 (**1** **Certificate of** **Distinction and 4 Certificates of Accomplishment****)**, we decided to extend our **Direct School Admission** (DSA) categories to include performing arts. Primary school leavers may now apply to join our school under Applied Learning Programme (ALP) \[Environment Education), Learning for Life Programme (LLP) \[Outdoor Education\], sports, and performing arts. We recruited 13 DSA students in 2021 and we look forward to more applicants in 2022.

Our Secondary 3 cohort can look forward to the modified Outward Bound Singapore (OBS) in late October and the Secondary 2 cohort enjoyed their outdoor day camp in May. Various face-to-face student development workshops for leadership development, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) skills (**IPAD for PDLP**), study skills and StrengthsFinder were also conducted to strengthen our students’ portfolios.

We are extremely pleased that the **Applied Learning Modules** (ApLM) at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and **Advanced Elective Modules** (AEMs) at the polytechnics have resumed. We have completed two AEMs for 40 Secondary 3 Express and 3 Normal (Academic) students at various polytechnics in March and will be attending 6 AEMs in June. The students will also participate in 6 Category A ApLM at ITE in late June.

As part of our regular yearly Education and Career Guidance (ECG) programmes, 18 speakers from various industries were invited to the school for our graduating cohort’s ‘Careers Day’. We can look forward to even more encouraging outcomes for our **Early Admission Exercise** (EAE) to both the ITE and Polytechnics this year. (In 2021, 46.4% of our Secondary 4 Express and 5 Normal \[Academic\] cohort successfully secured EAE offers to polytechnic, while 50.4% of our Secondary 4 Normal \[Academic\] and \[Technical\] cohort was successful in the EAE to ITE).

Another impactful strategy of the school is the provision of ample **student leadership development** opportunities. About 40% of our students assumed leadership positions in one of the six councils: the Student Council, the Class Council, the Environment Council, the Outdoor Education Council, the CCA Council and the Character and Citizenship Education (National Education/Cyber Wellness) Council. As a result, around **90.1%** of our graduating students received the **National Youth Achievement Silver Award** **(NYAA)** in 2021 and 97.1% of our students obtained either ‘Excellent’ or ‘Good’ for their CCA grades.

The School Advisory Committee (SAC) continues to generously support the school. Approval was obtained for an additional $20,000 to be set aside for around 300 **school-based awards** to reward students who show improvement in their studies.

The Marsiling Secondary School Alumni (MSSA) also continues to offer the **MSSA Bursary Award** ($250 each). 35 of such awards have been given since its inception to deserving graduates who are currently pursuing post-secondary education at the ITE, Polytechnics or Junior Colleges.

The advantages of joining Marsiling Secondary School may be summarised in our publicity tagline: **‘The Alternative Pathway’**, especially for the primary school leavers who have some disadvantages in terms of academic results. We will help them to regain their confidence, discover their interests, passion, strengths, and help them progress into post-secondary institutions of their choice.

We are indeed _progressing with values and knowledge_. The Head of Departments (HODs), teachers and all staff have been working together as a synergistic team to ensure smooth implementation of various initiatives – the Personal Digital Learning Programme (**using IPAD**), the blended learning and FSBB. We will overcome challenges and continue to strive to realise our vision to become _a community of dynamic, confident and caring learners’_.

With strong and generous support from the stakeholders, I am confident that MSS will thrive and _make our mark’_ (school motto) in the many years to come.

Thank you.
