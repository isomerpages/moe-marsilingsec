**Introduction to Lit-Art Interdisciplinary Project**  
The inaugural Lit-Art Inter-Disciplinary Project (IDP) which made its debut in 2018 aims to adopt an integrative approach to the teaching and learning of the two subjects through strengthening literacy skills, critical thinking and creativity through the use of visual images and living experiences for more in-depth comprehension of Literature text. Through this project, students develop their self-awareness and socio-emotional maturity as Literature and Art teachers engage in pedagogical exchanges to enhance their own teaching strategies. To create a new learning experience for our Secondary 1 cohort who is new to the subject Literature, they explore colours, caricatures and typography to access the characters in their Literature text better.

**Typography**  
The students learnt typography where they produce artistic arrangement of language and visuals to convey a message. Students use adjectives that best describe themselves. These adjectives also represent their impressions of some of the characters that they are learning in Literature lessons.

**Caricatures**  
In Lit-Art, students learnt caricatures to magnify and exaggerate specific features that best represent the traits that are dominant to themselves. This is to draw parallel to the study of the characters in the text _Stepping Up_ where there are certain character traits that are dominant in the different protagonists that they are learning.

**Mind-maps**  
Using knowledge of colours, lines and typography, the students created mind-maps to summarise visually their understanding of the characters in _Stepping Up_.

**Reflections**  
The Lit-Art Project concluded with students writing their reflection on the entire learning process, articulating the choices that they have made in designing their caricature and the ways in which they relate to the characters in the text _Stepping Up._
