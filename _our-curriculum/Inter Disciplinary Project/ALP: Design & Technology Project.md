Departments: ALP/Science, D&T and ICT

Class: Secondary 2 Express

Duration: Conducted during Project Work and Design & Technology lessons in Semester 1

**Information**  
Through this Interdisciplinary Project, the team aims to provide opportunities for students to acquire transferable skills such as communication, problem-solving and team work that focuses on student-centric learning experiences to develop their 21st CC, values and workplace readiness skills.

In 2019, students are given the revised task to _'create a prototype aimed at reducing carbon footprint in smart home or smart school using micro:bit technology’_. To further deepen students’ learning in the area of STEM and design process skills, the team has collaborated with ICT department to incorporate computational thinking. Students are exposed to a block-based coding called micro:bit. Through this collaboration, students are given opportunities to be innovative and creative in designing a working prototype that can help to solve environmental problems. Alternative assessments in the form of customised rubrics and checklists with feedback were designed to allow these competencies to be developed while giving students alternative modes to demonstrate their understanding. These alternative assessments help to build up students’ portfolio to enable them to apply for the different schools at the polytechnics through the Early Admissions Exercise (EAE).
