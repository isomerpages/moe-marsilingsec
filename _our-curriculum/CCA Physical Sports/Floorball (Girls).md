Marsiling’s Floorball CCA was formed in 2020 to cater to students’ interest. We aim to create a dynamic environment for the young ladies where they can excel. Trainings are of high intensity but yet fun. We hope to have more young ladies coming forward to train with us and make their mark during their stay with us and beyond.
