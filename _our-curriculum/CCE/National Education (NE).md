National Education (NE) is part of a holistic education. It aims to develop national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and boost students’ confidence in our nation’s future. It can develop students into citizens amid changing global social, economic and political contexts.

In Marsiling Secondary School, we customise our curriculum based on our students’ need and we ensure that there is a space for respectful conversations. We hope to nurture in our students open-mindedness and respect for others, and that they develop the skills for critical thinking.”

Besides commemorating the major events, the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Councillors share current affairs and contemporary issues with the school on stage during morning assembly. The introduction of monthly reading articles helps to deepen their understanding of the topics shared.

##### **National Education Commemorative Days** 

**Total Defence Day “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”**  
The theme for 2019’s Total Defence campaign – “Together We Keep Singapore Strong” – focuses on the many ways we can put Total Defence into action in our everyday lives.

On 15 February 1942, Singapore fell to the Japanese. We mark Total Defence Day on 15 February every year as a reminder of what could happen to us if we cannot defend Singapore ourselves, and to strengthen our resolve to keep Singapore safe, secure, and sovereign.

Singapore is facing a wider range of challenges and threats. They are complex and multi-faceted. They are also increasingly targeted at hearts and minds, aimed at breaking social unity and unsettling commitment to the nation. It is crucial for us to step up and play our part to strengthen our unity, resilience, and resolve in the face of these challenges and threats.

**International Friendship Day “Connected Communities”**  
While we appreciate and celebrate diversity, we must also maintain the social cohesion that is vital to peace and progress in a multi-cultural society. The significance of migrant workers and the controversial issue on Nationality Stereotypes were being discussed during CCE lessons and through the TDD assembly platform.

**Racial Harmony Day “The Singapore Connection”**  
On 21 July each year, schools commemorate Racial Harmony Day (RHD) to mark the anniversary of the 1964 racial riots. RHD serves as a reminder that promoting social cohesion and racial harmony requires collaborative efforts from everyone.

**NRIC Presentation Ceremony**  
15-year-old students receive their NRICs in a special ceremony and are encouraged to reflect on what it means to be Singaporeans through the NRIC presentation ceremonies. Despite their different backgrounds, these 15-year-old students must stand together and understand the shared privileges and responsibilities of being Singaporean.
