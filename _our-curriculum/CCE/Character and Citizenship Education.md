### **Our Vision**

*   Self-Directed Learners
*   Caring Individuals

Self-Directed Learner:  
A learner who questions, reflects, perseveres and takes responsibility for his own learning.

Caring Individual:  
An individual who contributes actively for the betterment of the community and the world. He will exhibit compassion and empathy towards others.

### **Our Mission**

*   To Provide Quality Learning And Nurture The Spirit of Caring

In Marsiling Secondary School, character development is not seen as a separate programme. We believe that everything that happens in school has an impact on pupils. Hence Marsiling Character and Citizenship Education Framework takes a comprehensive approach adapted from Lickona’s 12 Points Approach to Character Education, to develop the pupils holistically. Careful attention is given to the school culture, relationships and the formal and informal curricular so that values can be taught and caught.

The framework aims to develop performance character and moral character, so that pupils would always strive to do the best work they can as well as treat each other with care and respect. This is embodied in the 3As: Attendance & appearance, Attentiveness and Achievement, as well as our guiding principle of high care and high expectations.

### **Character and Citizenship Education Programme**

1.  The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Programme encompasses programmes organised as part of the school’s National Education (NE), Values In Action Programmes (VIA), Student Development and Education and Career Guidance programmes.

2.  The CCE outcomes for each level of pupils in our school are progressive and are aligned with the school’s vision and MOE’s 8 CCE Outcomes:
