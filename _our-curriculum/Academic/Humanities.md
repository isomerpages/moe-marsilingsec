**Department’s Vision**  
Developing Learners with a curious and caring mind.

**Department’s Mission**  
To nurture students to be critical thinkers who can contribute to society.

##### **Social Studies**  
The Social Studies Curriculum aims to develop students to be informed, concerned and participative citizens, competent in decision-making, who will contribute responsibly to the society and the world they live in.

*   Social Studies-Mathematics Interdisciplinary Project (IDP) has been a feature since 2018. Please click [here](https://marsilingsec.moe.edu.sg/social-studies-mathematics/) to find out more
*   Learning Journey to Jalan Besar Trail (exploring diversity in SG)
*   Learning Journey to Westlite Dormitory (exploring issue of having migrant workers in SG)
*   Infusion of ICT-based platforms such as Edmodo and Student Learning Spaces (SLS) to develop self-directed learning
*   Model United Nations (UN) participation since 2015

##### **Geography**  
Under the supervision of teachers, Geography lessons encourage first-hand experiences outside the classroom. As a more student-centered inquiry-based activity, the students first form their guiding questions and hypotheses on geographical issues they learn in class. During the fieldwork and post-fieldwork stages, teachers facilitate deep learning where students play a more active role in making sense of knowledge. The following are some examples of geographical issues that the students investigated this year:

**Secondary 1:** Is the quality of water at Mac Ritchie Reservoir good?  
**Secondary 2:** Do Marsiling residents feel a sense of belonging to their neighbourhood?  
**Secondary 3:** Do different places in the school have varied temperatures?  
**Secondary 4:** Is Marina Bay an attractive tourist destination?

##### **History**  
History allows students to draw connections between the past and present by understanding how the nature and impact of past developments explain today’s world.

**Lower Secondary History**  
The Lower Secondary History syllabuses seek to imbue in our students a sense of national identity by helping them understand the Singapore they live in today. This will require students to first understand the relevance of Singapore’s past in shaping Singapore’s unique position. It also aims to set the study of Singapore’s history within the context of developments from the 14th century to the 1970s.

These new syllabuses will also help history students to understand not just content concepts such as archaeology, history, colonial rule, migration, sense of belonging, independence and sovereignty, but also historical concepts such as chronology, evidence, diversity, historical significance, and change and continuity.

**Secondary One**  
Teachers have designed a Department designed a learning journey for the Secondary 1 History students to the Singapore River. This was to provide the students with opportunities for experiential learning. The objectives of the project were to:

*   enhance students’ understanding of the area around the Singapore River in the context of history (colonial period) viz a viz the present day;
*   develop students’ understanding about the historical concept of “Change and Continuity”;
*   trigger students’ curious mind to exercise critical thinking skills.

**Brief description of the Event:**  
In this Historical Investigation (HI), the students were divided into groups and were tasked to research on how transformation of Singapore as a British port  followed by the influx of immigrants to Singapore have impacted the area around the Singapore river in the aspects of jobs, infrastructure, entertainment, people and the Singapore river itself. Subsequently, students embarked on this learning journey to experience the current makeover of the area around the Singapore River in order to identify the changes and continues from the past. The deliverable for this project was to create a poster to display the changes and continuities in the area around the Singapore River.
