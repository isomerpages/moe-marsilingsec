    Category A Elective Modules are electives offered by ITE and here in Marsiling, most electives chosen are related to their subjects learnt in school (i.e. Elements of Business Skills, Science or Craft and Tech subjects) in order to help them apply learning and get to know how the learning of these subjects are extended in higher institutes of learning. Students who take Category A electives can gain accreditation to specific ITE modules pursued in ITE in future and obtain certification from ITE.
