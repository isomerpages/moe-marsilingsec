**Experience ITE Programme (EIP)**

To instill interest in skills and build aptitude, the Secondary 2 N(T) students will visit the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) for two days in an Experience ITE Programme (EIP).

**Elective Modules**

To broaden student’s perspectives of career prospects and opportunities, students are provided with unique learning experiences when they take elective modules. In Marsiling, students get to go through 2 Categories or elective modules which are the Category A Electives and Category B Electives.

*   Category A Elective Modules  
    Category A Elective Modules are electives offered by ITE and here in Marsiling, most electives chosen are related to their subjects learnt in school (i.e. Elements of Business Skills, Science or Craft and Tech subjects) in order to help them apply learning and get to know how the learning of these subjects are extended in higher institutes of learning. Students who take Category A electives can gain accreditation to specific ITE modules pursued in ITE in future and obtain certification from ITE.

*   Category B Elective Modules  
    Category B Elective Modules conducted by specialists in specific career industries allow students to have better awareness of career industries they can pursue in future and exposure and experience to specific industries students are interested in like the hospitality and engineering industries help them form aspirations for themselves for the future.

Students in Marsiling Secondary School have shown potential in various career industries. The learning they have undergone through these taster modules have instilled a renewed sense of passion for learning and a desire to work towards their areas of interests.
