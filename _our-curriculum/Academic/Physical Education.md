**Programmes**

In MSS, our PE department customises programmes and activities that are designed to develop Marsilians to be physically active, mentally resilient and socially competent individuals. Our department is committed to providing an enriching curriculum to enhance students’ experiences in Physical Education.&nbsp;

Students learn a variety of Sports skills, participate in the swim safer programme, Level camps, Outdoor skills, Sports Carnivals, Dance skills and compete in the school’s Annual Cross Country.&nbsp;

Through the rigours of the department’s programmes, our students will be able to maximize their potential and inculcate positive values and leadership skills. These platforms allow a majority of our students to attain the National Youth Achievement Award yearly. &nbsp;
