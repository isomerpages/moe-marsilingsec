**Signature Programme: TeenTalk**

Debuted in 2018, the MSS TeenTalk team leveraged the school’s Learning Journey to Nanyang Polytechnic in 2017, and initiated and developed the level-wide programme to develop 21st&nbsp;Century (communication &amp; information) skills for the Secondary Three cohort.

Established as the department’s signature programme, MSS TeenTalk programme encourages and nurtures competencies such as being a confident speaker and having a critical and inventive mindset.

Some of the benefits and outcomes of the The MSS TeenTalk include:

1.  availing Secondary Three cohort to the benefit of an assembly program as a platform to share their area of interest publicly and confidently
2.  intensive mentoring structure by respective EL teachers who train Secondary Three cohort in research and public speaking skills on a public platform (in-class presentation and assembly programme)
3.  students’ increased level of confidence in public speaking.
