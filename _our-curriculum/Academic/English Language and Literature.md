*   _Lit-Art Inter-Disciplinary Project_: a collaboration with Art Department for Secondary 1 Literature Curriculum
*   MSS Reading Programme: a Learning Hub initiative to develop English Language and Literature ambassadors through oral, reading and public presentation activities that include Bibliophile Awards, Author / Genre of The Month and BookFlix

**Signature Programme: TeenTalk**

Debuted in 2018, the MSS TeenTalk team leveraged the school’s Learning Journey to Nanyang Polytechnic in 2017, and initiated and developed the level-wide programme to develop 21st Century (communication & information) skills for the Secondary Three cohort.

Established as the department’s signature programme, MSS TeenTalk programme encourages and nurtures competencies such as being a confident speaker and having a critical and inventive mindset.

Some of the benefits and outcomes of the The MSS TeenTalk include:

1.  availing Secondary Three cohort to the benefit of an assembly program as a platform to share their area of interest publicly and confidently
2.  intensive mentoring structure by respective EL teachers who train Secondary Three cohort in research and public speaking skills on a public platform (in-class presentation and assembly programme)
3.  students’ increased level of confidence in public speaking.

##### **Learning Hub (Library)**

The Marsiling Bibliophile Award is introduced in 2019 to encourage Marsilians to develop the joy of reading. Reading develops critical thinking skills and aids in the mastery of the English Language. The Bibliophile Award is divided into two categories:  
Category 1: Individual Award  
Category 2: Class Award

For the Individual Award, the top three borrowers of the month will receive a prize to recognise their effort to read. For the Class Award, the class which borrows the highest number of books from the Learning Hub will be awarded with a certificate.
