<p><strong>Full Subject-Based Banding (SBB)</strong>
</p>
<p>Marsiling Secondary School is one of 30+ secondary schools which will
implement Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) from 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose of Full SBB</strong>
</p>
<p>With Full SBB, we are moving towards one secondary education, with many
subject bands, to better meet our studentsâ€™ learning needs. This is part
of the broader shift in our education system to recognise the strengths
and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence and
develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life.</p>
<p>By 2024, all secondary schools in Singapore will have implemented the
following aspects of Full SBB:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary
2; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum.</p>
</li>
</ul>
