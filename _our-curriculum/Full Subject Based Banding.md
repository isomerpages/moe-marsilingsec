<p><strong>Full Subject-Based Banding (SBB)</strong>
</p>
<p>Full SBB has been rolled out nationwide starting from the 2024 Secondary
1 cohort. Under Full SBB, students will be posted to secondary schools
through Posting Groups 1, 2 and 3 instead, and have greater flexibility
to offer subjects at different subject levels as they progress through
secondary school.</p>
