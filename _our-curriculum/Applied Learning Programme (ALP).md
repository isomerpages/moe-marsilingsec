**Eco-Sustainability through Inquiry-based Learning**

**DEVELOPING FUTURE PROBLEM SOLVERS** **– Nurturing the Next Generation of Green Leaders**

The school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – Eco-sustainability through Inquiry-Based Learning – is in the area of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).  Under the guiding hands of the ALP teachers, our students are provided with a myriad of learning experiences and opportunities on how they can play their part in building a sustainable future for Singapore through STEM experiences such as simple programming, prototyping and modern farming.

At Secondary 1, students get to explore the different types of sensors and simple coding skills using Arduino programme to create a smart bin and a waste sorter.

At Secondary 2, students are given opportunities to be innovative and creative in designing a working prototype that can help to solve issues related to energy conservation and efficiency through the use of Arduino programme or Micro:bit using computational thinking and design thinking principles. Proposed designs by students are then proudly presented to their peers and to a team of teacher mentors.

Beyond projects, a vertical vegetable farm amidst the school’s lush environment is one feature that is guaranteed to amaze any visitors who walk into the school’s compound. Students get the chance to try out modern farming in our own backyard and appreciate food sustainability. Since its installation in 2017, our students have annually harvested over 60 kilograms of vegetables to be shared within the school and Marsiling community. This high-tech method of farming is also integrated into the Lower Secondary Science curriculum where students get to discuss on issues related to food sustainability.

In support of the SG Green Plan 2030, the school endeavors to reduce carbon emissions. Other than the vertical farm, our school campus is also enhanced with sustainability features such as the solar panels, rainwater harvesting system and the biodiversity landscape. These features serve as learning infrastructures that are integrated into the overall ALP curriculum. These features help students to better appreciate issues related to sustainability and it provides the necessary experiential learning.

Our Environment Councillors (student leaders) serve as green ambassadors and become responsible stewards of the environment. Through various leadership opportunities, the Environment Councillors help to advocate sustainability mindsets and practices among their peers.
