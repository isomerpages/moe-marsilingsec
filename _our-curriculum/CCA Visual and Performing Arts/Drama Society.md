**Who We Are**

The Drama Society is a dynamic, inclusive space where imagination takes centre stage. Whether you're a natural performer, a curious creator, or someone just finding your voice, this is the place to express yourself boldly, grow with others, and bring stories to life.

**Our Mission**  
We aim to:

*   Spark creativity and self-expression through exciting drama experiences
*   Build a love for the performing arts that lasts a lifetime
*   Give students the freedom to explore their interests and uncover hidden talents
*   Develop confidence, discipline, and teamwork through meaningful collaboration
*   Provide structured opportunities to deepen drama-specific skills and values over time
*   Instil core values, social-emotional learning, and 21st-century competencies through performance and reflection

**What We Do**

**Weekly sessions focus on:**

**Presenting** – Students take the spotlight, performing regularly to build confidence and refine their craft  
**Responding** – Students learn to think critically, analyse performances, and express their ideas using appropriate drama vocabulary  
**Appreciating** – Students explore the significance of drama across cultures and generations, and how it connects to real life  
**Creating** – From scriptwriting to improvisation, students bring ideas to life through storytelling and performance techniques
