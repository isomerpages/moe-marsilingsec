*   Develop leadership qualities and problem-solving skills through self-directedness
*   Enhance students’ resilience and social-emotional competencies through the outdoor skills set
*   To appreciate the natural environment and understand importance of conservation and sustainable development
*   Infuse school values and nurture students to serve the community

Students are encouraged to use the existing Park Connectors (PCN) to complete various challenges. These PCNs routes are all safe and students have been advised to adhere to the SMM Rules (Social Distancing and a group size of between 3 and 5 people) Parents/Guardians are also encouraged to join your child/ward on this programme.

This is a self-directed programme where students can choose to complete the various challenges at their own time and pace.
