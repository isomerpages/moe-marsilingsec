**BUILDING LIFE SKILLS**

**VALOUR – Values and character Building through Outdoor Curriculum**

The school’s **_VALOUR_** programme develops our students holistically and enables them to develop the skills for the 21st Century. The Outdoor experiences exposes students to varied challenges allowing them to nurture their leadership potential and overcome obstacles to persevere and achieve their goals.

In the **_VALOUR_** programme, students are provided with opportunities to progressively nurture their practical problem solving skills, creativity and ruggedness. Students from Sec 1 to Sec 5 go through customised activities to cater to their diverse needs that infuse life skills, school values and SEL competencies. Students experience customised outdoor challenges in their Sec 1 Orientation Camp, Sec 2 Adventure Camp, Sec 3 Leadership Workshop & OBS.  Finally, our Sec 4 & 5 students can apply the skills sets acquired throughout the years by participating in an overseas expedition. Beyond providing unforgettable outdoor experiences, each of these programmes is an opportunity to teach our students leadership skills: how to take care of themselves and others in the outdoors and instilling resilience in them to overcome daily challenges. Marsilians are exposed to the leadership component adapted from the leadership Challenge model in the following tiers:

*   Tier 1 : All students provided opportunities for self-leadership
*   Tier 2 : Focus on Team Leadership catering to the Students’ Leadership groups
*   Tier 3 : Inspirational Leadership for EXCO group of student leaders, through community engagement efforts.

Altogether, there are six student leadership groups for Marsilians to choose from. Each group represents an important area defined by the school for students to contribute and grow. They are the class Council, Student Council, Character and Citizenship (CCE) Council, Co-Curricular (CCA) Council, Environment Council (EC) and Outdoor Education Council (OE). Interested students can select their choice at Secondary One before being appointed at Secondary Two.

**Mountain Trekking in Taiwan 2019**

Our Secondary 4 and five students were given the opportunity to go for a 5 days 4 nights overseas trip to climb the highest peak in Taipei. Students enjoyed camping under the stars in tents and cooking sumptuous meals in the outdoors. The unique experience enhanced their ability to work together effectively as a team and enriched their personal leadership qualities.
